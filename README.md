# ForgeAPI

This project generates an API jar with symbols for building Minecraft Forge mods.

Only symbols are included (net.minecraft, net.minecraftforge, etc.) so you can build
your mod against this API jar, but running it requires Minecraft.

To use in your project, inherit from: https://github.com/agaricusb/ForgeMod
